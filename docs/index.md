# Mapping Mozzie #
This describes a quadplane mapping drone that is meant to be useful to the [American Red Cross and others](https://americanredcross.github.io/rcrc-drones/activities.html). The goal is an affordable mapping drone that is easy to build, service and repair.

A quadplane was chosen because it combines vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) with good range. Another benefit of a quadplane is redundancy: if the plane has issues the quad motors can take over, and vice versa. This project borrows heavily from the [Mozzie quadplane](https://mozzie.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

This project requires knowledge including robotics, aviation and fabrication. However, the documentation is meant to be useful to novices. The build avoids special tools & equipment.

Here are the main sections to the documentation:  
* [Parts](/parts/partslist.md): Most parts have their own document listing purchase options, specs, alternatives, etc
* [Tasks](/tasks/taskorder.md): Each task is meant to contain a bite-sized list of steps. Many tasks can be done concurrently, as indicated on the task list. This can speed production if the build is being done by a team.
* [Tools, supplies, ground items](toolsetc.md)
* [Safety, FAQ & notes](faq.md)
